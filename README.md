Note on submission:

We apologize for the incomplete submission in the previous version. Due to overlapping work and other commitments, we need a few more days to finalize the missing components:

- Working install.sh script
- Executable run.sh scripts
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions, dependencies, and expected outputs

We plan to upload the complete artifact **by October 12**.We provide a fully functional artifact reproducing the main results on CIFAR-10. 
Support for CIFAR-100 and STL-10 is also included and can be easily activated following the instructions.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. We will notify here as soon as the updated artifact is ready.
