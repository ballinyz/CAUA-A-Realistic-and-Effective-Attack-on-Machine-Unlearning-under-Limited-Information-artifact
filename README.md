Thank you for your detailed feedback. We sincerely apologize for the incomplete submission in the previous version.

Due to overlapping work and other commitments in the past week, we need a few more days to finalize the missing components, including:

A working install.sh script

Executable run.sh scripts

A comprehensive README with setup instructions, dependencies, and expected outputs

We plan to upload the complete artifact by October 5â€“6. We truly appreciate your understanding and patience, and will notify here as soon as the update is ready.
