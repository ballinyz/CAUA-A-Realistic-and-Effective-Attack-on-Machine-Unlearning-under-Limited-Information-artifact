CAUA: A Realistic and Effective Attack on Machine Unlearning under Limited Information - Artifact

This artifact provides a comprehensive evaluation of Machine Unlearning services under limited information scenarios.

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- torch
- torchvision
- tqdm
- numpy
All dependencies can be installed via:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Datasets (please download before running):
- CIFAR-10
- CIFAR-100
- STL-10

Note on submission:

We apologize for the incomplete submission in the previous version. Due to overlapping work and other commitments, we need a few more days to finalize the missing components:

- Working install.sh script
- Executable run.sh scripts
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions, dependencies, and expected outputs

We plan to upload the complete artifact **by October 8**. Initially, we will provide a working version for **CIFAR-10**, and later extend support to **CIFAR-100 and STL-10**. 

Thank you for your understanding and patience. We will notify here as soon as the updated artifact is ready.
